    NOTICE:

    This context is usually accessed via the external sip profile listening on port 5080.
    
    It is recommended to have separate inbound and outbound contexts.  Not only for security
    but clearing up why you would need to do such a thing.  You don't want outside un-authenticated
    callers hitting your default context which allows dialing calls thru your providers and results 
    in Toll Fraud.
